Lakiesha Duclos is what her husband loves to call her though she doesn't really like being called like that. His friends say it's not good for him but what he loves doing is to play lacross and he's been doing it for quite a while. Since she was 18 she's been working as a computer operator but soon she'll be on her own. Her house is now in Massachusetts and she loves every day living there.
