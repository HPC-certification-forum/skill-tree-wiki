Online poker rake differs in several ways. The first is that the percent of rake that is usually taken is 5% and this is almost always capped at $3. Not only is there usually a maximum $3 collection, but there is almost always no minimums. In some games the pot will need to be as large as $30 before the house collects their percentage.
