Because most players realize that contributing $2 in order to win $1 is a tough proposition, most poker rooms will allow the small blind and big blind to 'chop'. This means that they can both receive their blinds back if they both agree that it is acceptable. This has to be done before the flop and no other players can be in the hand. Poker rooms that do collect rake no matter how many players there are if there is a flop, usually have a 'no flop, no drop' policy. This means that if there is no flop, no matter how many raises or how big the pot, the house will not collect any money from the flop. It needs to be remembered that not all live poker rooms collect rake if there is a flop. This is sometimes regional, but can also vary from poker room to poker room in the same region.
