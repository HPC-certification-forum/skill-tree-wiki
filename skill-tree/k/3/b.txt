# K3-B
# Name: Program Parallelization
# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  the typical parallelization techniques used at the intra- and inter-node level of cluster systems 
  *  the causes of parallelization overheads, which eventually prevent efficient use of an increasing number of processing elements 
  *  domain decomposition strategies (i.e. splitting a problem into pieces that allow for parallel computation)
