# K2-B
# Name: Performance Modeling
# Background
  *  HPC systems are massively parallel and therefore sophisticated parallel programs are required to exploit their performance potential as much as possible. 
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  how the performance of parallel programs may be assessed
