# K1.2-B
# Name: Hardware Architectures
# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  elementary processing elements like CPUs, GPUs, many core architectures 
  *  vector systems, and FPGAs 
  *  the NUMA architecture used for symmetric multiprocessing systems where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to the processor 
  *  network demands for HPC systems (e.g. high bandwidth and low latency) 
  *  typical network architectures used for HPC systems, like fast Ethernet (1 or 10 Gbit) or InfiniBand
