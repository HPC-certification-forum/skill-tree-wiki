# K1.2-E
# Name: Hardware Architectures
# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  parallelization techniques at the instruction level of a processing element (e.g. pipelining, SIMD processing) 
  *  hybrid approaches, e.g. combining CPUs with GPUs or FPGAs 
  *  typical network topologies and architectures used for HPC systems, like fat trees based on switched fabrics using e.g. fast Ethernet (1 or 10 Gbit) or InfiniBand
