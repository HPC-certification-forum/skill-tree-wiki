# SE1.2.1-B
# Name: Parallel Algorithms
# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  understand that some algorithms are embarrassingly (i.e. trivially) parallelizable while their parallelization will vary from easy to hard in practice 
  *  determine the computational complexity of algorithms
