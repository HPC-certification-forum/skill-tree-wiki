# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  debug a program using simple techniques such as inserting debugging output statements into the source code, e.g. using printf â€“ also against the background of potential problems with the ordering of the (stdout) output that may exist in parallel environments like MPI 
  *  the common concepts and workflows when using a debugger (commands like step into, step over, step out, breakpoints) 
  *  use sophisticated debuggers such as GDB
