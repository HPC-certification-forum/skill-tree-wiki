# USE3-I
# Name: Building of Parallel Programs
# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  run parallel programs in an HPC environment 
  *  use a compiler and to asses the effects of optimization switches available for compilers commercially available (e.g. PGI, NAG) 
  *  use efficient open source libraries (e.g. OpenBLAS, FFTW) or highly optimized vendor libraries (e.g. Intel-MKL, IBM-ESSL) 
  *  configure the relevant settings (e.g. by setting compiler and linker options), which determine how the application ought to be build with regard to the parallelization technique(s) used (e.g. OpenACC, C++ AMP) 
  *  use the profile guided optimization (PGO) technique 
  *  use software building environments like Scons, Waf, make, Autotools, CMake
