# USE3-B
# Name: Building of Parallel Programs
# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  build parallel programs, e.g. via open sources packages 
  *  run parallel programs in an HPC environment 
  *  use a compiler and to asses the effects of optimization switches available for the relevant compilers (e.g. GNU, Intel) 
  *  use a linker and to assess the effects of linker specific options and environment variables (e.g. -L and LIBRARY_PATH, -rpath and LD_RUN_PATH) 
  *  configure the relevant settings (e.g. by setting compiler and linker options), which determine how the application ought to be build with regard to the parallelization technique(s) used (e.g. OpenMP, MPI) 
  *  use software building environments like make, Autotools, CMake
