# USE3-E
# Name: Building of Parallel Programs
# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  run parallel programs in an HPC environment 
  *  use a linker and to assess the effects of advanced linker specific options and environment variables (e.g. LIBRARY_PATH) 
  *  configure the relevant settings (e.g. by setting compiler and linker options), which determine how the application ought to be build with regard to advanced parallelization technique(s) used (e.g. CUDA) 
  *  use the profile guided optimization (PGO) technique 
  *  use software building environments like Scons, Waf, make, Autotools, CMake
