# USE2-B
# Name: Running of Parallel Programs
# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  run parallel programs in an HPC environment 
  *  use the command line interface 
  *  write robust job scripts, e.g. to simplify job submissions by the help of automated job chaining 
  *  select the appropriate software environment 
  *  use a workload manager like SLURM or TORQUE to allocate HPC resources (e.g. CPUs) and to submit a batch job 
  *  consider cost aspects 
  *  measure system performance as a basis for benchmarking a parallel program 
  *  benchmark a parallel program 
  *  tune a parallel program from the outside via runtime options 
  *  apply the workflow for tuning
