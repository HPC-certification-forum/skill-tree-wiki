# PE3-I
# Name: Benchmarking
# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  assess speedups and efficiencies as the key measures for benchmarks of a parallel program 
  *  differentiate between strong and weak scaling 
  *  assess the performance characteristics of parallel programs with regard to CPU usage, memory accesses (e.g. latencies for random access, cache sizes, strided access patterns, and bandwidth), I/O operations (e.g. record length, IOPs, latency, bandwidth, throughput, and multi-stream processing), and communication (message sizes, network bandwidth and latency)
