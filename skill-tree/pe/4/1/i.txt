# PE4.1-I
# Name: Tuning without Building a Parallel Program
# Background
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  select appropriate tasks sizes (big vs. small) that may have positive performance impacts on the workflow, and to run several (smaller) tasks by the help of job chaining 
  *  use mapping of processes to nodes, pinning of processes/threads to CPUs or cores, and setting memory affinities to NUMA nodes in order to speed up a parallel program 
  *  speed up program execution by setting appropriate runtime options (e.g. for MPI and OpenMP)
